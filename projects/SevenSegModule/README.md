Features
----------------------

The ADC input is converted to voltage.
(It assumes vdd  = 5V) which maps 0-1023 to 0-5V ranges. So will look like 3-02 
for 3.02V. The 10-bit ADC (0 to 1023) value is read from a pot attached to PIC pin RA4(PORT A)
The value is read on a interrupt generated by overflow of timer0 every second.
A status LED on RA2 toggles on same Timer.

RA4 = Analog In.
RA2 = Status LED.

*4 digit 74HC595 module*

These modules have 5 pins, 3 data lines + power. They have a common anode
4 digit seven segment display(3461BS) and two 74HC595 shift registers.

3 pins are connected from PORT C of PIC to the data lines of the 74HC595 module.
These modules are widely available also you can easily built your own as per schematic. 
They have two shift registers daisy chained together which allows user to 
control a 4 digit seven segment display with just THREE GPIO pins.

The data must be sent in two bytes , first byte of data to display data on segment
second byte controls which digit to write to. The display uses 3461BS common anode
so data must be inverted(from common cathode) so 0x3F becomes 0xC0 for a Zero symbol.
Also due to way its wired data must be sent in MSB first.
