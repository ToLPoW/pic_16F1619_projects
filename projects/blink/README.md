A program to blink an LED attached to GPIO.RA2 second in C using "delay_ms" function. 
The code is written in C using the xc8 complier for the  Microchip Curiosity Board
the LED on RA2 is an in built LED on the development board.

In this folder the main source code in C for program can be found in file main.c
The bulk of the code was generated using the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC)
These files are in folder called mcc_generated_files

MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) is a free, graphical programming environment that generates ,
C code to be inserted into your project. It is built in to the MPLAB IDE
Using an interface, it enables and configures a rich set of 
peripherals and functions specific to the application.
